#  Class Roster

I completed this project during my second semester at WGU as a part of the class, Scripting and Programming Applications C867. 
This project is a C++ application designed to maintain a current roster of students within a given course. The IDE I used is Visual Studio 2022. It features two primary classes: Student and Roster.  Student data for the program include student ID, first name, last name, email address, age, an array of the number of days to complete each course, and degree program.
The program reads a predefined list of five students, parses the data, and creates corresponding student objects. It utilizes function calls to manipulate and analyze the data. Key functionality includes displaying all students, filtering by degree program, validating email addresses, and calculating the average number of days spent on courses.
All outputs are directed to the console.

To run this application, open the code files in Visual Studio Code 2022. Then, start the application by clicking the green arrow.
